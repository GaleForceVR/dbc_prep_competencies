# DBC Prep Objectives
Congratulations on your acceptance to Dev Bootcamp! In order to get everyone ramped up for Phase 0, as well as to quench your thirst for more knowledge and skills, we’ve put together the following list of objectives and resources for you to prepare yourself for the Phase 0 (and Dev Bootcamp) experience! 

The objectives are separated into two main sections. Each section is prefaced with "Before Entering Phase 0."

1. **"I need to be able to..."**<br> You **must** feel comfortable with these objectives to hit the ground running on day one of Phase 0. If you have no programming experience, this section should probably take you around 20-30 hours to do well. 

2. **"It would be great to be able to..."** <br> These concepts will be addressed in a later part of Phase 0, so you have more time to prep these.

3. **Additional Resources** (optional)


Make the best use of your time before Phase 0 by pushing yourself to practice and demonstrate as many of these objectives as you can. 


*Note:* You may need to go through resources and tutorials more than once to understand and be able to demonstrate each objective. That is OK. Do what you need to to feel confident and comfortable with each objective. Test yourself often by demonstrating your ability to do each thing.


For any technical support, please feel free to scope out and post in the <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/groups/devbootcamp.help/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp Help Facebook group</a>.

# Before Entering Phase 0
## I need to be able to:

#### 1. Personal Preparation

You are about to embark on a new learning experience. You will be challenged in new ways that will excite and frustrate you (sometimes at the same time). It's important to prepare yourself for success by recognizing how you learn best and what you enjoy when you are in a learning environment. Recognizing what you need will help you be able to express what you need when learning and make your experience at Dev Bootcamp more fulfilling. You will be spending a significant amount of time working with others, so it's also vital to practice explaining your ideas to others. *Keep track of the your explanations and results below. You will be asked to submit your responses prior to entering Phase 0.*

Learning Objectives:

- [ ] Explain the difference between <a href="http://michaelgr.com/2007/04/15/fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset-which-one-are-you/" target="_blank">growth and fixed mindset</a>.
- [ ] Identify my 
<a href="http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=questionnaire" target="_blank">VARK learning style</a>.
- [ ] Explain my <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" target="_blank">thinking style</a> and what I enjoy or find challenging when learning
- [ ] Introduce basic programming concepts to another person!<br> *What did you explain? What questions did the other person ask? How could you explain the topic better in the future? What did you learn from this experience?*

#### 2. Computer Set-Up

It is fundamentally important that you have a working development environment on your computer so that you can easily and effectively run the programs you are writing. Great developers are able to setup, maintain, and upgrade their development environment to meet the demands of the project they are working on. This is equivalent to a carpenter keeping their workspace clean, organized, and stocked with the right tools. *Follow the directions in one of the following resources to get started.* 

- <a href="http://docs.railsbridge.org/installfest/" target="_blank">RailsBridge Installfest instructions</a><br>*Follow the instructions for your operating system. There is no need to create a Heroku account or deploy a rails app.*

2. <a href="http://it-ebooks.info/book/36/" target="_blank">Chris Pine, *Learn to Program*</a>, Chapter 1.<br>*Be sure to install Sublime Text 2 rather than TextMate!*

Learning Objectives:

- [ ] Install Ruby version 2.0 <br> *Check the version by running “ruby –v” from the command line. You may need to update.* 
- [ ] Install DBC’s preferred text editor - Sublime Text.
- [ ] Run a ruby program from Sublime in my terminal<br> *Use <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/news/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-free-course/" target="_blank">Perfect Workflow in Sublime Text</a>*
- [ ] Use IRB to play with Ruby code (*HINT*: Type IRB into your terminal)


#### 3. Command Line

Have you ever been afraid to go in to your terminal? Do you know what the terminal is? The terminal will be your best friend for most of Phase 0 and Phase 1, so it's important to get comfortable with some basic commands that will help you navigate through directories.  

Description here:

Resource: <a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/" target="_blank">The Command Line Crash Course</a> 

Learning Objectives:

- [ ] Navigate between directories

- [ ] Identify the directory I are in
- [ ] Move a file between from one directory to another
- [ ] Copy a file or directory
- [ ] Open a file in a text editor
- [ ] Run a ruby file

#### 4. Ruby
Computers are not the most intelligent things, but they are obedient and willing to do things repeatedly without a fuss. The trick is knowing how to tell a computer to do what you want. Computers don't understand innuendo and they take everything literally. (Thankfully they don't hold grudges). It's vital to success in Phase 0 and Dev Bootcamp that you can solve simple challenges using Ruby. In order to be able to do this, you will need to be feel confident with the following objectives. 

Read <a href="http://it-ebooks.info/book/36/" target="_blank">*Learn to Program*</a> by Chris Pine, chapters 3-15.

#### Object-Oriented Design

- <a href = "http://www.poodr.com/" target="_blank">*Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby*</a> By Sandi Metz. This book is definitely not required or necessary reading prior to Phase 0, but it is incredibly useful in Phase 1 and beyond. It may take a couple reads before you will fully follow, but it's a great investment.

#### Rails

- <a href = "http://ruby.railstutorial.org/" target="_blank">Michael Hartl's RoR Tutorial</a> A decent introduction to the power of rails. In this tutorial, you build a simple Twitter app using Test-Driven Development. It introduces you to Databases, ERB (embedded ruby), RSpec, CSS. This is not required, and you will likely not understand all of the code you will write, but if you want the satisfaction of building something from scratch, it's a decent start.
